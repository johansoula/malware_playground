DESCRIPTION:

In this repository, you will find python script strongly inspired by Plague Scanner.

First scripts were intended to check hashes on Virus total API to find known malware (Dridex,Locky,...) and to also use local Linux antiviruses (Bitdefender,ClamAV,...)

Second scripts were using online threat platform to create ClamAV database using hashes gathered online (malw.com, hybrid analysis, virusshare, virusign...)

In batch mode only, no Queue (Plague scanner is great for that).
It is not to benchmark AV, it was to find malware in SMTP Mail flow when received and later on (AV updates).
Once found, the security team triggered Incident Response investigation and so son.
